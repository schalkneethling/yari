## Quickstart

Before you can begin with Yari, you need [Content](https://github.com/mdn/content).
See its README which basically, says something like this:

    git clone https://github.com/mdn/content.git mdn/content

Now, you just need to note where that folder is before you can start Yari.

To run Yari locally, you'll first need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>= 12.0.0) and
[Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
After that, run these commands in your bash:

    git clone https://github.com/mdn/yari.git
    cd yari
    yarn
    echo CONTENT_ROOT=/path/to/mdn/content/files >> .env
    yarn dev
    open http://localhost:3000

Make sure you point to the `/files` folder inside your clone of the content
repo.

If you prefer, you can fork the repo first and do the `git clone` with
_your_ fork instead of the `mdn` one.

The `yarn dev` command will compile and prepare certain files. This always
takes a little extra time. If you prefer you can use `yarn start` which
will re-use any previously compiled files which is "riskier" but faster.
The `yarn start` command will also start a server which doesn't automatically
reload when its source code files change, so use with caution.

See also our [reviewing guide](docs/REVIEWING.md) for information on how to
review Yari changes.

### How to stay up-to-date

Periodically, the code and the content changes. Make sure you're staying
up-to-date with these commands:

    git pull origin master
    yarn
    yarn dev

These are also good steps to always take when you embark on making a change.
Then, the only extra command needed is `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
(or however you prefer to create new `git` branches)

## License

All source code is [MPL-2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

For content, see its [license](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
in the [mdn/content repository](https://github.com/mdn/content).

## How it works

Yari is multiple things but at its core is the MDN content as `index.html`
files, in `git`, that contain the metadata (as front-matter) and
the bulk of the document.

The builder converts these "source files" into "build files" using a CLI tool
that iterates over the files, builds the HTML, and lastly packages it up
with the front-end code, ready to be served as static files.

## Development

First of all, development on `yari` can mean the source code (e.g. the
styling of the header) or it can mean the content, since it's all one
repo. This document doesn't distinguish between the two. In the future we
might expand with more documentation specifically for contributing to the
content exclusively.

The `yarn start` command encapsulates the front-end dev server
(on <http://localhost:3000>) and the `server` (on <http://localhost:5000>).

All the sub-commands of `yarn start` can be broken down and run individually
if you want to work more rapidly.

### Setting up `$EDITOR`

If you configure an environment variable called `EDITOR`, either on your
system as a whole or in the root `.env` file, it can be used in the development
server to link to sources which, when clicked, opens in
your preferred editor/IDE. For example, in the root:

    echo 'EDITOR=code' >> .env

Now clicking certain links will open files directly in the currently open
VSCode IDE. To test it, view any document on <http://localhost:3000> and
click the "Open in your editor" button.

### How the server works

The `server` has two main jobs:

1. Simulate serving the site (e.g. from a server, S3 or a CDN).
2. Trigger builds of documents that haven't been built, by URL.

### Linting

All JavaScript and TypeScript code needs to be formatted with `prettier`
and it's easy to test this with:

    yarn prettier-check

And conveniently, if you're not even interested in what the flaws were, run:

    yarn prettier-format

But automatically when you ran `yarn` the first time (`yarn` is an alias for
`yarn install`) it set up a `git` pre-commit hook that uses `pretty-quick`
which is a wrapper on `prettier` that checks only the files in the git
commit.

If in doubt about formatting, you can create a pull request and if you have
formatting flaws, the pull request checks should catch it.

### Upgrading Packages

We maintain the dependencies using `Dependabot` in GitHub but if you want
to manually upgrade some you can use:

    yarn upgrade-interactive --latest

### Sharing your dev environment with `ngrok`

[`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) is a great tool for starting a HTTP proxy
server from the Internet into your Yari server. This can be useful for testing
your current build on external tools like BrowserStack, WebPageTest,
Google Translate, or to simply show a friend what you're up to. Obviously
it'll never be faster than your uplink Internet connection but it should
be fairly feature complete.

1. [Create in account on Ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
2. [Download the executable](https://ngrok.com/download)
3. Start your Yari server with `yarn start` in one terminal
4. Start the `ngrok` executable with: `/path/to/your/ngrok http 5000`

This will display something like this:

    Session Status                online
    Account                        (Plan: Free)
    Version                       2.3.35
    Region                        United States (us)
    Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
    Forwarding                    http://920ba2108da8.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
    Forwarding                    https://920ba2108da8.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000

    Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                                0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

Now, take that "Forwarding" URL `https://920ba2108da8.ngrok.io` (in this
example) and share it.

## Building

The `server` builds content automatically (on-the-fly) when you're viewing
pages. But if you want to you can pre-emptively build all the content
in advance. One potential advantage is that you can get a more complete
list of all possible "flaws" across all documents before you even visit them.
The most fundamental CLI command is:

    yarn build

### What gets built

Every `index.html` becomes two files:

- `index.html` fully formed and complete HTML file
- `index.json` the React needed state to build the page in the client

### Flaw checks

When building you can enable specific "flaw checks" and their level of
handling. Some flaws are "cosmetic" and some are more
severe but they should never block a full build.

More information about how to set flaws can be found in `docs/envvars.md`.

Essentially, the default is to _warn_ about any flaw and you can see
those flaws when using <http://localhost:3000>. But for completed builds,
all flaws are ignored. This makes the build faster and there's also
no good place to display the flaws in a production-grade build.

**In the future**, we might make the default flaw level `error` instead.
That means that any new edits to (or creation of) any document will break
in continuous integration if there's a single flaw and the onus will
be on you to fix it.

## Icons and logos

The various formats and sizes of the favicon is generated
from the file `mdn-web-docs.svg` in the repository root. This file is then
converted to favicons using [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
To generate new favicons, edit or replace the `mdn-web-docs.svg` file
and then re-upload that to realfavicongenerator.net.

## Troubleshooting

Some common issues and how to resolve them.

### `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`

There are two options to resolve this.

1. Disable the watcher via [`REACT_APP_NO_WATCHER`](docs/envvars.md#react_app_no_watcher)

   `echo REACT_APP_NO_WATCHER=true >> .env`

2. Increase `max_user_watches`:\
   See <https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers>

### `Error: Cannot find module 'levenary'`

We can't know for sure what's causing this error but speculate a bug in how `yarn`
fails to resolve if certain `@babel` helper libs should install its own
sub-dependencies. A sure way to solve it is to run:

    rm -fr node_modules
    yarn install
